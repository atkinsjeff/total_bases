Messing with pitcher's hitting data

This respoitory includes an R script that imports baseball hitting data from a sorted file from 
http://www.baseball-reference.com/ and sorts the file to find only pitchers and then creates a new column 
calculating the stats TOTAL BASES, a common baseball stat calculated where a single = 1, a double = 2, a triple = 3, 
and a home run = 4. 

Ultimatly, this script will be used to calculate scoring for a fantasy league focuse on pitcher hitting stats.
